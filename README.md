# HauntingHouse

## Intro

This is another story of home automation - a complete 3 flat appartment house that was renovated from scratch.

I tried to built my own knowledge in this area and keep the information for the poor guy to come and manage the house someday.

I must admit, it is a **lot** of work and in the meantime I may have missed some of the issues and workarounds I encountered on the way. And now, as I see this is a neverending work I decided to release the book in this "under construction" state. Even as it already has about 140 pages, there may come another 140 and it is still not complete. It's futile to wait.

So, if you expect a fully fledged complete and revised book, stay away. If you expect some useful help (and maybe offer some of your own valuable advice) - be welcome.

## State

Now the project is already in a mature state. The building is used for nearly a year now. All the lights are still working, nobody has frozen in winter and the water is warm all day.

Home automation changes rapidly these days and some of the decisions might already be obsolete today. I hope I can keep up with new technology and add new ideas as they are implemented.

## Acknowledgement

There are a lot of sources that I used while creating this book. It is simply impossible to backtrack all the infos reliably to an originator, use it as kind of a compilation of "best practices" (at least I hope so).

If there's someone around who thinks I'm summarizing a concept basically originated by her, please contact me. 

I'm grateful for any input that will improve the content of the book and invite anbody to be published as co-author of this one. In this case, please accompany any input you provide with the claim that you accept it's use under the license you see imprinted here.

## Don't nudge/grumble/nag

This book is written in Word. I know, you don't like it. For me, it was the only way to bring in some personal preferences regarding layout and appearance. 

I did (and still do) use services like "leanpub" and I know that it may be perfectly suited to a project like this. You can even participate in writing. But visual appearance is very restricted and even simple "gimmicks" like table and pics required ugly workarounds in my last book. As there are enough compromises in my home control, leave me at least a visual appealing description thereof.

For now, I invite you to use Word in revision mode or to send input simply via mail.
